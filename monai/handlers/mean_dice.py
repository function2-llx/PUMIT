        Args:
            include_background: whether to include dice computation on the first channel of the predicted output.
                Defaults to True.
            reduction: define the mode to reduce metrics, will only execute reduction on `not-nan` values,
                available reduction modes: {``"none"``, ``"mean"``, ``"sum"``, ``"mean_batch"``, ``"sum_batch"``,
                ``"mean_channel"``, ``"sum_channel"``}, default to ``"mean"``. if "none", will not do reduction.
            num_classes: number of input channels (always including the background). When this is None,
                ``y_pred.shape[1]`` will be used. This option is useful when both ``y_pred`` and ``y`` are
                single-channel class indices and the number of classes is not automatically inferred from data.
            output_transform: callable to extract `y_pred` and `y` from `ignite.engine.state.output` then
                construct `(y_pred, y)` pair, where `y_pred` and `y` can be `batch-first` Tensors or
                lists of `channel-first` Tensors. the form of `(y_pred, y)` is required by the `update()`.
                `engine.state` and `output_transform` inherit from the ignite concept:
                https://pytorch.org/ignite/concepts.html#state, explanation and usage example are in the tutorial:
                https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/master/modules/batch_output_transform.ipynb.
            save_details: whether to save metric computation details per image, for example: mean dice of every image.
                default to True, will save to `engine.state.metric_details` dict with the metric name as key.
