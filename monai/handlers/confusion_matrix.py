        Args:
            include_background: whether to include metric computation on the first channel of
                the predicted output. Defaults to True.
            metric_name: [``"sensitivity"``, ``"specificity"``, ``"precision"``, ``"negative predictive value"``,
                ``"miss rate"``, ``"fall out"``, ``"false discovery rate"``, ``"false omission rate"``,
                ``"prevalence threshold"``, ``"threat score"``, ``"accuracy"``, ``"balanced accuracy"``,
                ``"f1 score"``, ``"matthews correlation coefficient"``, ``"fowlkes mallows index"``,
                ``"informedness"``, ``"markedness"``]
                Some of the metrics have multiple aliases (as shown in the wikipedia page aforementioned),
                and you can also input those names instead.
            compute_sample: when reducing, if ``True``, each sample's metric will be computed based on each confusion matrix first.
                if ``False``, compute reduction on the confusion matrices first, defaults to ``False``.
            reduction: define the mode to reduce metrics, will only execute reduction on `not-nan` values,
                available reduction modes: {``"none"``, ``"mean"``, ``"sum"``, ``"mean_batch"``, ``"sum_batch"``,
                ``"mean_channel"``, ``"sum_channel"``}, default to ``"mean"``. if "none", will not do reduction.
            output_transform: callable to extract `y_pred` and `y` from `ignite.engine.state.output` then
                construct `(y_pred, y)` pair, where `y_pred` and `y` can be `batch-first` Tensors or
                lists of `channel-first` Tensors. the form of `(y_pred, y)` is required by the `update()`.
                `engine.state` and `output_transform` inherit from the ignite concept:
                https://pytorch.org/ignite/concepts.html#state, explanation and usage example are in the tutorial:
                https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/master/modules/batch_output_transform.ipynb.
            save_details: whether to save metric computation details per image, for example: TP/TN/FP/FN of every image.
                default to True, will save to `engine.state.metric_details` dict with the metric name as key.
