    """
    Computes the Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) for each batch sample and class of
    predicted segmentations `y_pred` and corresponding reference segmentations `y` according to equation :eq:`nsd`.
    This implementation is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05408 and supports 2D and 3D images.
    Be aware that by default (`use_subvoxels=False`), the computation of boundaries is different from DeepMind's
    mplementation https://github.com/deepmind/surface-distance.
    In this implementation, the length/area of a segmentation boundary is
    interpreted as the number of its edge pixels. In DeepMind's implementation, the length of a segmentation boundary
    depends on the local neighborhood (cf. https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04430).
    This issue is discussed here: https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/issues/4103.

    The class- and batch sample-wise NSD values can be aggregated with the function `aggregate`.

    Example of the typical execution steps of this metric class follows :py:class:`monai.metrics.metric.Cumulative`.

    Args:
        class_thresholds: List of class-specific thresholds.
            The thresholds relate to the acceptable amount of deviation in the segmentation boundary in pixels.
            Each threshold needs to be a finite, non-negative number.
        include_background: Whether to include NSD computation on the first channel of the predicted output.
            Defaults to ``False``.
        distance_metric: The metric used to compute surface distances.
            One of [``"euclidean"``, ``"chessboard"``, ``"taxicab"``].
            Defaults to ``"euclidean"``.
        reduction: define mode of reduction to the metrics, will only apply reduction on `not-nan` values,
            available reduction modes: {``"none"``, ``"mean"``, ``"sum"``, ``"mean_batch"``, ``"sum_batch"``,
            ``"mean_channel"``, ``"sum_channel"``}, default to ``"mean"``. if "none", will not do reduction.
        get_not_nans: whether to return the `not_nans` count.
            Defaults to ``False``.
            `not_nans` is the number of batch samples for which not all class-specific NSD values were nan values.
            If set to ``True``, the function `aggregate` will return both the aggregated NSD and the `not_nans` count.
            If set to ``False``, `aggregate` will only return the aggregated NSD.

    This function computes the (Normalized) Surface Dice (NSD) between the two tensors `y_pred` (referred to as
    :math:`\hat{Y}`) and `y` (referred to as :math:`Y`). This metric determines which fraction of a segmentation
    boundary is correctly predicted. A boundary element is considered correctly predicted if the closest distance to the
    reference boundary is smaller than or equal to the specified threshold related to the acceptable amount of deviation
    in pixels. The NSD is bounded between 0 and 1.

    This implementation supports multi-class tasks with an individual threshold :math:`\tau_c` for each class :math:`c`.
    The class-specific NSD for batch index :math:`b`, :math:`\operatorname {NSD}_{b,c}`, is computed using the function:

    .. math::
        \operatorname {NSD}_{b,c} \left(Y_{b,c}, \hat{Y}_{b,c}\right) = \frac{\left|\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}^{'}\right| +
        \left| \mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}^{'} \right|}{\left|\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}\right| +
        \left|\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}\right|}
        :label: nsd

    with :math:`\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}` and :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}` being two sets of nearest-neighbor
    distances. :math:`\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}` is computed from the predicted segmentation boundary towards the reference
    segmentation boundary and vice-versa for :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}`. :math:`\mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}^{'}` and
    :math:`\mathcal{D}_{\hat{Y}_{b,c}}^{'}` refer to the subsets of distances that are smaller or equal to the
    acceptable distance :math:`\tau_c`:

    .. math::
        \mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}}^{'} = \{ d \in \mathcal{D}_{Y_{b,c}} \, | \, d \leq \tau_c \}.


    In the case of a class neither being present in the predicted segmentation, nor in the reference segmentation,
    a nan value will be returned for this class. In the case of a class being present in only one of predicted
    segmentation or reference segmentation, the class NSD will be 0.

    This implementation is based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05408 and supports 2D and 3D images.

    boundary is interpreted as the number of its edge pixels.

        spacing: spacing of pixel (or voxel). This parameter is relevant only if ``distance_metric`` is set to ``"euclidean"``.
            If a single number, isotropic spacing with that value is used for all images in the batch. If a sequence of numbers,
