### DiNTS: Differentiable Neural Network Topology Search for 3D Medical Image Segmentation
MONAI integrated the `DiNTS` module to support more flexible topologies and joint two-level search. It provides a topology guaranteed discretization algorithm and a discretization aware topology loss for the search stage to minimize the discretization gap, and a cost usage aware search method which can search 3D networks with different GPU memory requirements. For more details, please check the [DiNTS tutorial](https://monai.io/research/dints.html).

### Accounting for Dependencies in Deep Learning Based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Imaging
For [classification of digital pathology whole slide images (WSI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01556), MONAI introduces new transforms and network modules for multiple instance learning. These include self-attention transformer blocks for explicitly accounting of the dependencies between instances (image patches) during training. For more details, please check out the [multiple instance learning tutorial](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/master/pathology/multiple_instance_learning). ![multi-instance](../images/mil-patches.jpg)

### Self-supervised representation learning
MONAI starts to explore self-supervised representation learning in this milestone release. The Vision Transformer has been extended to learn from self-supervised reconstruction tasks with various data augmentation and a regularized contrastive loss. The weights of the pre-trained backbone could be used to enhance the performance of the novel downstream deep learning tasks.

The [tutorial](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/master/self_supervised_pretraining) shows how to generate a good set of pre-trained weights using unlabeled data with self-supervised tasks, then use the pre-trained weights to perform fine-tuning on a fully supervised volumetric segmentation task using a transformer based `UNETR`.

### Swin UNETR model for the task of multi-organ segmentation
For [Swin UNETR: Swin Transformers for Semantic Segmentation of Brain Tumors in MRI Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01266), MONAI introduces new network modules for multi-organ segmentation task using the BTCV challenge dataset. The architecture of Swin UNETR:

The [tutorial](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/blob/main/3d_segmentation/swin_unetr_btcv_segmentation_3d.ipynb) shows a typical pipeline of multi-organ segmentation based on Swin UNETR model, DiceCE loss function, Mean Dice, etc. And we used weights from self-supervised pre-training of Swin UNETR encoder (3D Swin Transformer) on a cohort of 5050 CT scans from publicly available datasets.

### DeepGrow modules for interactive segmentation
[A reimplementation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/tree/master/monai/apps/deepgrow) of the DeepGrow components, which is deep learning based semi-automated segmentation approach that aims to be a "smart" interactive tool for region of interest delineation in medical images, originally proposed by:

### DeepEdit workflow for interactive segmentation
DeepEdit is a method that combines an automatic and a semi-automatic approach for 3D medical images into a single deep learning-based model. The [implementation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/tree/dev/monai/apps/deepedit) of the DeepEdit modules provides essential components for interactive segmentation. More details are available in the training and inference [tutorial](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/deepedit/ignite).

The following figure shows the typical workflow of interactive segmentation:

### NuClick modules for interactive nuclei segmentation
NuClick is a CNN-based approach to speed up collecting annotations for microscopic objects requiring minimum interaction from the annotator. The [implementation](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI/tree/dev/monai/apps/nuclick) contains essential components for the training and inference workflows of NuClick interactive nuclei segmentation.

These include image similarity measures as loss functions, bending energy as model regularization, network architectures, warping modules. The components can be used to build the major unsupervised and weakly-supervised algorithms.
